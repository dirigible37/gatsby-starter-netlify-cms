## Work:
Today wasn't a very exciting day at work. It mainly consisted of sending our code to the customer and helping them set it up on their system. Tomorrow we will be testing it on their environments. The bulk of today was just spent prepping for tomorrow!

## School:
Today I got started on the first project of the semester. We need to replicate some findings from a paper by Richard S Sutton named "Learning to predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences." The findings in question are some statistics gathered by testing the TD solver on a "random walk" problem. Today, in starting the project, I simply implemented the "random walk" simulation. Basically, you have N nodes in a line (for example, A-B-C-D-E-F), and the game ends when you reach an end-point (A or F). You can only move to the left or right by one each turn, and it's a 50/50 chance deciding which way you move. It was a simple simulation to put together, but it's the basis of this project, and a good starting place.  

## Side Projects:
My time today was mainly spent on work and school, I wasn't that productive on the side projects. I made some slight modifications to the "cook mode" feature, but nothing substantial. I hope to get more into a rhythm again with grad school, so I can work more on this!
