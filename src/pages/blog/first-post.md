Well, this is my first blog post! I'm hoping to get some tags and organization in the future, but I decided I was putting up too many roadblocks to get started blogging. 

Creating a personal blog has been on my to-do list for quite a while, and I can finally check it off! I want this blog to be a place for me to gather my thoughts at the end of every day, as well as a place to discuss things I've learned or things I have opinions on. Therefore, I am planning to write almost every day (probably not weekends). Currently I work as a technical consultant at SAS as my 9-5. When I get home, my time is split between my wife and kids (our cat and dog), my grad school program, and my personal projects. It's a lot. Because it's a lot, I usually have a lot to think about at the end of the day. Because of this, my blog will primarily be a sounding board for my ideas, as well as a place to remember and recognize what I achieved that day. It's far too easy to just let the days slip away one by one, floating into the abyss of "the past." I hope this blog will be the anchor of every day, so it's not truly lost to the whims of my memory (which can be quite terrible). 

If you have an interest in the life and musings of a technical consultant at a statistical software company, a husband, a masters degree student, and an aspiring entrepreneur, I hope you follow along and learn with me. If you have any suggestions, please reach out. 

Signing Off,

Winslow
